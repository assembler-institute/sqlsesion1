    "## What's SQL\n",
    "SQL stands for Structured Query Language. This languaje allows us to interact with relational databases to manage and analyze the information stored in the DB.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL is a standard languaje but the different versions have their own extensions and commands (like SQL Server, MySQL, MariaBD, ...)\n",
    "\n",
    "## What SQL can do\n",
    "- execute queries against a database\n",
    "- retrieve data from a database\n",
    "- insert records in a database\n",
    "- update records in a database\n",
    "- delete records from a database\n",
    "- create new databases\n",
    "- create new tables in a database\n",
    "- create stored procedures in a database\n",
    "- can create views in a database\n",

    "## SQL Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "A database most often contains one or more tables. Each table is identified by a name (e.g. \"Customers\" or \"Orders\"). Tables contain records (rows) with data. We can also have Views in our database which are equivalent to a table with the difference that they reference a table and encapsule a SQL Query. \n",
    "\n",
    "### SQL commands\n",
    "You have to have in mind that the SQL commands are not case sensitive, so `SELECT` is equivalent to `select`. Some database systems require a semicolon at the end of each SQL statement. Semicolon is the standard way to separate each SQL statement in database systems that allow more than one SQL statement to be executed in the same call to the server, but as mentioned, they are mostly optional.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This are the most important commands to have in mind**\n",
    "- SELECT -> extracts data from a database\n",
    "- UPDATE -> updates data in a database\n",
    "- DELETE -> deletes data from a database\n",
    "- INSERT INTO -> inserts new data into a database\n",
    "- CREATE -> creates new items (no data), it's combined with DATABASE, TABLE, VIEW, or INDEX\n",
    "- ALTER DATABASE -> modifies a item (no data), combined with DATABASE and TABLE\n",
    "- DROP TABLE -> deletes an item (no data), combined with TABLE, DATABASE, VIEW ..."

    "## Entity - Relation model\n",
    "\n",
    "The entity-relationship model is a tool to generate the data model that describes the structure and relationships of a database. These models at the same time are describing a real situation, with real elements that are related to each other. For example: The activity of a fruit warehouse, or without going any further, the activity of this same forum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, the concrete activity of, for example, loading a fruit truck is not being described. But it is being described that in this reality (the fruit warehouse) there is an entity called COURIERS, which is related to another entity called ORDERS, where the latter will be acquired, and therefore are related, by another entity called CUSTOMERS, etc. ..\n",
    "\n",
    "The entity-relationship model is a diagram that helps generate the data structure with which to manage a real problem or activity. Once this model has become a structure within the database, that is, the tables with their primary and foreign keys, through SQL it is possible both to maintain the operation of the activity by feeding the database, and to analyze the data for the benefit of activity. For example, in the case of the fruit warehouse, the data structure should allow registering customer orders, but also and consequently, obtain the sales per customer in a given period."

    "### Strong and weak relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of entities, the strong ones, sometimes called masters, that independently identify their records with their own key, and the weak ones that depend on a strong entity to identify their records, or if you want, their existence makes no sense without a strong entity to lean on. A typical example of a weak entity is the INVOICE_LINES entity that depends on the INVOICES master to identify its records. The cardinality of this relationship is from 1 to N, since an invoice can have several lines while a line can only belong to one invoice. Well, in the weak entity LINEAS_INVOICE the primary key will be composed and the ID_INVOICE field will be part of it, which in turn will be a foreign key of the INVOICES table. The other field that will form the primary key will be, for example, ID_LINEA, so that to identify a record of the LINEAS_INVOICES entity, the key of its master or strong entity is needed in addition to ID_LINEA. Example: invoice: 92054 line: 3 identifies line 3 of invoice 92054. The cardinality of the relationship of a weak entity with its master or strong entity will always be from 1 to N. \n",

    "![er_facturas](er_facturas.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have doubts about what nature to apply to an entity, the following tips may help:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the nature of the records for the entity being studied can change their parent in the future, it is surely a strong entity.\n",
    "- If the parent entity of the entity whose nature is being studied simply groups records, sometimes being doubtful as to which parent to associate with a child record, or if you want there are several equally valid candidates, it is probably a strong entity.\n",
    "- If the nature of the entity under study is not expected to have too many records for the same parent, that is, it will have a relatively small number of records for a given parent, and apart from its possible master it is hardly related to other entities, then probably be a weak entity.\n",
    "- If the entity whose nature is being studied is related to many other entities in such a way that we must create keys foreign to the entity being analyzed in all of them, then even if it is a weak entity, it may be convenient to assess identifying its records with its own key. and make it strong. Otherwise we will need to port the composite key to all these related entities to create the foreign keys."
