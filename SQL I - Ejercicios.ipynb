    "\n",
    "A health insurance company wants to design a database to computerise part of its hospital management. In the first phase, it only wants to consider the following semantic assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The hospitals in its network can be either its own or contracted; in addition to data common to all of them, such as the hospital code, its name, number of beds, when the hospital is its own, there are other specific data such as the budget, type of service.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A policy, which is identified by a policy number, has several attributes that, in principle, are not important to specify and are grouped under the name of policy data. A policy covers several insurers, which are identified by a sequential number, added to the policy code, and have a name, date of birth.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The insurers covered by the same policy can be of different categories. While first-category insured persons can be admitted to any hospital, second-category insured persons can only be admitted to their own hospital.\n",
    " \n",
    "- It is of interest to know in which hospitals the insured persons are hospitalised, the doctor who prescribed the hospitalisation, as well as the start and end dates of the hospitalisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are areas, identified by a code and with data on their surface area and number of inhabitants. Hospitals that are contracted must be assigned to a single area, which cannot change, while the owned hospitals are not assigned to areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Doctors, who are identified by a code, have a name, contact telephone number. It is of interest to know the areas to which a doctor is assigned. There is a hierarchical dependence between doctors, so that a doctor has only one boss.\n",

    "\n",
    "During the holidays kids can go to camp houses with other kids to perform activities and live there for some weeks. In the houses the kids can do some activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is of interest to have an evaluation of the activities offered by the houses.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A numerical rating is assigned to indicate the level of quality of each of the activities offered.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The holiday camp houses accommodate children who have registered to spend a short holiday in them. \n",
    "\n",
    "- There are different types of these houses (rural houses, houses with swimming pool, luxury houses). \n",
    "\n",
    "- We want to have a record of the number of children staying in each of the houses at the moment. \n",
    "\n",
    "- It is to be assumed that there are houses that are empty (no children are staying in them) for some seasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Of the children currently staying in any of the houses, it is of interest to know a code assigned to them to identify them, their first name, their surname, their parents' telephone number and their province of residence.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the counties where there are houses or where children live, the surface area and the number of inhabitants should be recorded. It should be taken into account that there may be counties where none of the children who stay at a given time in the holiday camp houses reside, and counties that do not have any houses at all.\n",

    "### 3.- The bank\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim is to design a database for the personnel management of a particular bank with a large number of employees and a wide network of branches. The following description summarises the requirements of the users of the future personnel database:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Employees are identified by an employee code, and we also want to know their ID, SSN, first name and surname. It will be important to register their city of residence, considering that there are cities where no employee resides.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The bank branches are identified by a name that makes it possible to distinguish between branches in the same city. It is important to record the number of inhabitants of the cities as well as their names, addresses and telephone numbers of the branches. It must be taken into account that the database also includes cities where there is no agency.\n",
    "\n",
    "- An employee, at a given time, works in only one agency, but this does not prevent him/her from being transferred to another agency or even from returning to work in an agency where he/she has worked before. It is desirable to have a record of the history of employees' time in the agencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Employees may have academic qualifications (although not all do). You want to know what qualifications employees have.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Each employee has a specific job category (assistant, second officer, first officer, etc.). Each category has a certain basic salary and a certain hourly rate for overtime. You want to have a record of the current category of each employee, and the basic salary and overtime rate for each category.\n",
    " \n",
    "- Some employees (not all) are members of a trade union. An agreement has been reached to deduct the union dues from the monthly payroll for those who are members of each union. This fee is the same for all members of a given central. It is necessary to store the employees' affiliations to a central and the corresponding dues to the different trade union centres.\n",
    " \n",
    "- There are two different types of employees:\n",
    "    - Those with permanent contracts, whose seniority we want to know.\n",
    "    - Those with temporary contracts, whose start and end dates of their last contract we want to know.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a temporary employee becomes permanent, a new employee code is assigned to him/her; we will consider that a permanent employee never becomes temporary. All of the above (transfers, grades, union membership, etc.) applies to both permanent and temporary employees.\n",
    " \n",
    "- Permanent employees have the possibility to apply for different pre-defined types of loans (marriage, house purchase, study, etc.), which may or may not be granted. In principle, there is no restriction on taking out several loans at the same time, as long as no more than one of the same type is taken out at the same time. You want to record the loans requested by employees, and whether or not they have been granted. Each type of loan has different conditions attached to it; of these conditions, in particular, you will be interested in the interest rate and the term of the loan.\n",

    "### 4.- The power company\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim is to monitor the electrical energy produced and consumed in a given country. It is based on the following hypotheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are basic electricity producers that are identified by a name, whose average production, maximum production and date of entry into operation are of interest. These basic producers are of one of the following categories: Hydro, Solar, Nuclear or Thermal. For a hydroelectric power plant or dam, we are interested in its occupancy, maximum capacity and number of turbines. \n",
    "\n",
    "- For a solar power plant, we are interested in the total surface area of solar panels, the annual average number of hours of sunshine and type. For a nuclear power plant, we are interested in the number of reactors it has, the volume of plutonium consumed and the volume of nuclear waste it produces. For a thermal power plant, we are interested in the number of furnaces it has, the volume of coal consumed and the volume of its gas emissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For national security reasons, it is of interest to control the plutonium supplied by a nuclear power plant. This control refers to the amount of plutonium purchased from each of its possible suppliers (name, country) and carried by a given carrier (name, registration number).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each day the producers deliver the energy produced to one or more primary stations, which may receive a different amount of energy from each of these producers on a daily basis. The producers always deliver the total of their production (control this attribute). The primary station is identified by its name and has a number of low to high voltage transformers and is the head of one or more distribution grids.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A distribution network is identified by a network number and can have only one primary station as head-end. Ownership of a network may be shared by several electricity companies, each company being identified by name.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Surplus energy in one of the grids can be sent to another grid. The total volume of energy exchanged between two grids is recorded.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A grid is composed of a series of lines, each line is identified by a sequential number within the grid number and has a certain length. The smallest possible line will supply at least two substations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A substation whose number is known is served by one line and distributes to one or more service areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In each service area, which we will identify with a code, we wish to record the average consumption and the number of end consumers.\n",

    "The Soda Springs Chess Club has been commissioned by the International Chess Federation to organise the next world championships to be held in Soda Springs. For this reason, the club wishes to enter into a database all the management related to participants, accommodation and games. Bearing in mind that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Players and referees are taking part in the championship; from both of them it is required to know the number of associate, name, address, contact telephone number and championships in which they have taken part. The level of play of the players is also required on a scale of 1 to 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "- No referee can participate as a player.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The countries send a set of players and referees to the championships, although not all countries send participants. Each player and referee is sent by only one country. A country may be represented by another country.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each country is identified by a sequential number according to its alphabetical order and, in addition to its name, the number of chess clubs in that country is of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each game is identified by a sequential number (cod_p), is played by two players and refereed by an arbiter. It is interesting to register the games played by each player and the colour (white or black) with which he/she plays.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Both players and arbiters stay in one of the hotels where the games take place, we want to know in which hotel and on which dates each of the participants has stayed. For each hotel, we would like to know the name, address and telephone number.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Each game is held in one of the rooms available in the hotels. For each room, we would like to know the capacity and the means available to facilitate the broadcasting of the matches. One of the rooms may have several different facilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The identification of moves is established on the basis of an order number within each game: for each move, the move (5 positions) and a brief commentary by an expert are recorded.\n",
